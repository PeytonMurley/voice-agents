Branch Design Challenge: What was the most challenging part of designing the conversation branches? Did you discover anything about how voice agents handle different conversation paths?

    Most challenging part:
    Figuring out which questions belong in each branch and setting the right conditions was the hardest part. Some questions fit more than one branch, so organizing them took time.

    What I learned:
    I learned that the agent follows the first matching condition and that conditions must be very clear. If something doesn’t match any branch, the agent gives a default “outside my       knowledge” answer.

Knowledge Base Impact: How did the knowledge base content you added affect the agent's responses? Did certain types of content work better than others?

    The knowledge base made the agent give more accurate and consistent answers. Short, focused topics worked the best. Broader content didn’t affect responses as much because the model filled in the gaps itself.

Real-World Application: What real-world application could this voice agent have? Think about a specific industry, business, or use case where this type of agent would be valuable.

    This type of voice agent would be useful for aquarium stores, reef tank businesses, or maintenance services. It can answer beginner questions, give quick help, and support customers 24/7.
